\textnormal{\linespread{0.5}{\\\normalsize{\indent When the incident angle is $\theta<\theta_c$ , the reflection coefficient
decreases slowly with the incident angle, and when it is
$\theta>\theta_c$ , the reflection coefficient increases quickly with the
angle. It can also be seen from Figs. 2 and 3 that the sensitivity
of porosity variation is more important than the sensitivity
of tortuosity on the reflection coefficient at the first interface.

\textbf{V. INVERSE PROBLEM}
\\ [1ex]
\indent The propagation of acoustic waves in a slab of porous
material in the high frequency asymptotic domain is characterized
by four parameters: porosity $\phi$, tortuosity $\alpha_\infty$ , viscous
characteristic length $\Lambda$, and thermal characteristic
length $\Lambda'$, the values of which are crucial to the behavior of
sound waves in such materials. It is of some importance to
work out new experimental methods and efficient tools for
estimation of them. The basic inverse problem associated
with the slab may be stated as follows: from measurement of
the signals transmitted and/or reflected outside the slab, find
the values of the medium’s parameters. The inverse problem
has been solved in transmission mode in Refs. 4–6 and an
estimate of $\alpha_\infty$, $\Lambda'$, and $\Lambda'$ made therein that gives a good
correlation between experience and theory. Porosity was not
estimated in this mode because of its weak sensitivity. Porosity
was estimated in reflected mode in our previous\\\\}}}

Electronic interference was removed by 1000 acquisition averages.
